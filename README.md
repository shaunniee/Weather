  <ol>
  <li>React: Learning to build a weather web application using React involves gaining proficiency in this popular front-end JavaScript library, which can be used to create reusable UI components, manage state, and update the UI efficiently.</li>
  <li>Styling using CSS Modules and SCSS: Styling a web application involves using CSS to apply visual styles to the HTML elements. In this project, CSS Modules and SCSS were used to write modular and maintainable styles for the components.</li>
  <li>API integration: Integrating an API involves making requests to a server to retrieve data or perform actions. In this project, the Weather API was used to retrieve weather data based on the user's input.</li>
  <li>State management using Hooks: State management is a crucial aspect of building a React application. In this project, the useState and useEffect hooks were used to manage state and perform side effects such as fetching data from an API.</li>
  <li>Front-end workflow: The front-end workflow involves the process of designing, developing, testing, and deploying a web application. In this project, various tools and techniques were used to optimize the workflow and ensure the application meets the requirements and expectations of the users.</li>
  <li>Critical thinking and problem-solving: Building a web application involves identifying and solving technical challenges, improving the user experience, and ensuring the application meets the requirements. This requires critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which can be developed through practice and experience.</li>
  <li>Conditional rendering: Conditional rendering involves displaying different content or components based on a condition. In this project, conditional rendering was used to display error messages when there was an issue with retrieving the weather data from the API or when the user input was invalid.</li>
